# Project Context: PSOMER-CAMP Data Analysis

This is an R-based data analysis project. The main goal is to analyze the heart disease dataset to understand the factors associated with heart disease.

## Key Files

*   `code/dataset_prep_and_exploratory_analysis.Rmd`: This is the primary script for data preparation. It loads the raw data, adds column names, creates the `any_heart_disease` outcome variable, and filters the data.
*   `code/analysis.Rmd`: This script is for statistical modeling. It loads the processed data and runs analyses like logistic regression.
*   `data/heart_data.csv`: This is the processed data file, generated by `dataset_prep_and_exploratory_analysis.Rmd`. It should be the input for analysis scripts.

## Workflow

1.  **Data Preparation**: All data cleaning, variable creation (e.g., `any_heart_disease`), and filtering should be done in `code/dataset_prep_and_exploratory_analysis.Rmd`.
2.  **Analysis**: Statistical analysis is performed in separate scripts like `code/analysis.Rmd`, which load the cleaned data from `data/heart_data.csv`.
3. **Debugging**: the user will upload screenshots of bugs into the bugs folder, review these when you hit errors
## Key Variables & Logic

*   **`any_heart_disease`**: The binary outcome variable. It is created from the `num` column (`ifelse(num > 0, 1, 0)`).
*   **Inclusion Criteria**: The dataset is filtered to include only individuals with an `age` between 40 and 70.
